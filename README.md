# Wren's Channel Archive

On [2025/09/11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f557698-04d7-4504-9682-0ecde7a19327) [Wren](https://www.youtube.com/@Wren6858) requested that fans of her music archived her YouTube channel.

> The hammer is coming down.
> YouTube made the decision to take down my most popular original to date, "The Ballad of Luigi Mangione".
> I fully disagree with this decision and plan to appeal it, but ultimately the results of it are out of my hands.
> YouTube does not want this song to exist, and unless I radically change my content, it appears they don't want this channel to exist either.
>
> I ask you all to archive the music I have put out on this channel.
> I ask you to to follow my sound-cloud Wr3n at this link here:

> I ask that you take this as a lesson as to what kind of creative expression is tolerated and what kind is not.
> There's a reason Bob Dylan achieved commercial success and why Phil Ochs did not.
> Similarly, there is a reason Jesse Wells has made a good deal of money off his work, and I play on the sidewalk.
> Some things you just aren't allowed to say.
>
> I have a good deal of respect for him.
> I hope I'm able to get some assistance should this rise to the level of channel deletion or further strikes.
> But either way, no matter what happens, I will be back, and I will keep sharing music.

I've made a best effort archive here and have left it to auto-refresh from time to time.
Some songs are age-gated and there isn't really a way to by-pass that here,
some other videos are too long to archive due to file size limitations,
these have been (unforunately) ommited.
